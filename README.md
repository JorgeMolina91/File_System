# file-system
## This is a little file system built in Python.



It supports commands: ls, cd, mkdir and touch.

It implements the persistent object 'shelve' to create the dictionary in which those commands are stored 
to be used with the PyFilesystem's 'fs'

Once the script runs, it will create a file called 'user_file_system.fs', in which all the information (commands) are placed.
